4,Which square has the highest density of buildings within 100 meters in 1808?,spatial,a single entity name,1,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Load the datasets**

* Load the 1808 Buildings Dataset into a data frame for further analysis.
* Load the Landmarks Dataset into a separate data frame for further analysis.

**Step 2: Preprocess the data**

* In the 1808 Buildings Dataset, convert the 'building_functions' column into a list of functions per row, similar to the 1740 Buildings Dataset.
* Ensure that the 'district' column in the 1808 Buildings Dataset is in a format that can be used for spatial analysis (e.g., convert to a consistent format if necessary).

**Step 3: Calculate building density**

* For each building in the 1808 Buildings Dataset, calculate the distance to the nearest landmark (church or square) using the longitude and latitude coordinates.
* Filter the buildings that are within 100 meters of a landmark.
* Count the number of buildings within 100 meters of each landmark.
* Calculate the density of buildings within 100 meters for each landmark by dividing the count of buildings by the area of the square with a side length of 200 meters (100 meters radius).

**Step 4: Identify the landmark with the highest density**

* Sort the landmarks by their density in descending order.
* Select the landmark with the highest density.

**Step 5: Determine the final answer**

* The final answer will be the name of the landmark with the highest density of buildings within 100 meters in 1808.","import pandas as pd

5,Is the building rent price correlated with the distance from the nearest square in 1740?,spatial,yes or no,1,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to analyze the given question:

**Step 1: Understand the question and datasets**

* The question asks whether there is a correlation between the building rent price and the distance from the nearest square in 1740.
* We have three datasets: Buildings 1740, Buildings 1808, and Landmarks.
* The Buildings 1740 dataset contains information about buildings in 1740, including rent price and location.
* The Landmarks dataset contains information about squares and churches in Venice.

**Step 2: Calculate the distance from each building to the nearest square**

* Load the Buildings 1740 and Landmarks datasets.
* Calculate the distance from each building to the nearest square using the longitude and latitude coordinates.
* We can use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere (such as the Earth).
* This will give us a new column in the Buildings 1740 dataset with the distance to the nearest square.

**Step 3: Explore the relationship between rent price and distance to the nearest square**

* Load the updated Buildings 1740 dataset with the calculated distance to the nearest square.
* Use a scatter plot or correlation analysis to explore the relationship between rent price and distance to the nearest square.
* This will help us visualize whether there is a correlation between the two variables.

**Step 4: Check for correlation**

* Calculate the correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson's r) between rent price and distance to the nearest square.
* If the correlation coefficient is close to 1 or -1, there is a strong positive or negative correlation.
* If the correlation coefficient is close to 0, there is no correlation.
* This will help us determine if there is a significant relationship between rent price and distance to the nearest square.

**Step 5: Answer the question**

* If the correlation coefficient is close to 0, the answer is no (i.e., there is no correlation).
* If the correlation coefficient is not close to 0, the answer is yes (i.e., there is a correlation).

6,Is the building area correlated with the distance from the nearest square in 1808?,spatial,yes or no,1,0,"Here is a step-by-step plan to analyze the given question:

**Step 1: Understand the question and datasets**

* Review the question and the three provided datasets: buildings_1740, buildings_1808, and landmarks.
* Note that the question asks about the correlation between building area and distance from the nearest square in 1808.
* Identify the relevant columns in the datasets: building_area in buildings_1808 and longitude/latitude in both buildings_1808 and landmarks.

**Step 2: Calculate the distance from each building to the nearest square in 1808**

* Merge the buildings_1808 dataset with the landmarks dataset on the longitude and latitude columns.
* Use a spatial join or a distance calculation (e.g., Haversine distance) to find the nearest landmark (square) for each building in the buildings_1808 dataset.
* Store the distance to the nearest square as a new column in the merged dataset.

**Step 3: Calculate the correlation between building area and distance to the nearest square**

* Use a correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson's r) to calculate the correlation between the building_area column and the distance to the nearest square column.
* Note that the correlation coefficient will range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating no correlation.

**Step 4: Determine the answer**

* Interpret the correlation coefficient value:
	+ If the correlation coefficient is close to 1 or -1, there is a strong positive or negative correlation between building area and distance to the nearest square.
	+ If the correlation coefficient is close to 0, there is no correlation between building area and distance to the nearest square.

**Step 1: Load the datasets**
Load the three datasets into a data analysis software or a programming language (e.g., Python) for further processing. This will allow us to access the data for analysis.

**Step 2: Understand the datasets**
 Familiarize ourselves with the structure and content of each dataset, including the columns and data types. Specifically, we need to focus on the 1808 Buildings Dataset, which contains information about the district that each building is located at.

**Step 3: Identify the district with the most buildings**
In the 1808 Buildings Dataset, we need to count the number of buildings in each district. This can be done by grouping the data by the ""district"" column and counting the number of rows in each group.

**Step 4: Determine the district with the highest count**
We need to identify the district with the highest count of buildings from the previous step. This can be done by finding the maximum count and associating it with the corresponding district.

**Step 5: Verify the district with the most buildings**
To ensure that the district with the highest count is indeed the one with the most densely located houses, we can calculate the average number of buildings per square unit in each district. However, since we don't have the exact area of each district, we can assume that the district with the highest count is also the one with the most densely located houses.

15,Are low-rent buildings with less than average rent price clustered in specific areas in 1740?,spatial,yes or no,0,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Understand the question and datasets**
We need to determine if low-rent buildings with rent prices less than the average rent price in 1740 are clustered in specific areas. We have three datasets: Buildings 1740, Buildings 1808, and Landmarks. We'll focus on the Buildings 1740 dataset to answer this question.

**Step 2: Calculate the average rent price in 1740**
We need to calculate the average rent price in the Buildings 1740 dataset to determine what constitutes a ""low-rent"" building. We'll use the `rent_price` column in the dataset to perform this calculation.

**Step 3: Identify low-rent buildings in 1740**
We'll filter the Buildings 1740 dataset to include only the rows where the `rent_price` is less than the average rent price calculated in Step 2.

**Step 4: Determine the locations of low-rent buildings**
We'll extract the `parish` column from the filtered dataset in Step 3 to identify the locations of the low-rent buildings.

**Step 5: Analyze the distribution of low-rent buildings**
We'll examine the distribution of low-rent buildings across different parishes to see if they are clustered in specific areas. This can be done by grouping the data by `parish` and counting the number of low-rent buildings in each parish.

**Step 6: Compare with Landmarks dataset (optional)**
To provide more context, we can compare the locations of low-rent buildings with the locations of landmarks (churches and squares) in the Landmarks dataset to see if there's any correlation.

**Step 7: Draw a conclusion**
Based on the analysis in Step 5, we'll determine if low-rent buildings with less than average rent price are clustered in specific areas in 1740. If the low-rent buildings are concentrated in a few parishes, we'll conclude that yes, they are clustered in specific areas. Otherwise, we'll conclude that no, they are not clustered in specific areas.

The final answer will be a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" based on the analysis.","import pandas as pd

16,Are small buildings with smaller than average building size clustered in specific areas in 1808?,spatial,yes or no,0,0,"Here is a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Understand the question and datasets**
First, we need to understand what the question is asking and what information is available in the datasets. We are looking for areas in 1808 where small buildings (smaller than average building size) tend to cluster together. We have three datasets: buildings in Venice from 1740, buildings in Venice from 1808, and landmarks in Venice. We will focus on the 1808 Buildings Dataset and the Landmarks Dataset.

**Step 2: Calculate the average building size in 1808**
We need to calculate the average building size in the 1808 Buildings Dataset to determine what ""smaller than average"" means. We will calculate the mean of the building_area column in the 1808 Buildings Dataset.

**Step 3: Identify small buildings in 1808**
Using the average building size calculated in Step 2, we will identify the buildings in the 1808 Buildings Dataset that have a building_area smaller than the average.

**Step 4: Group small buildings by district**
We will group the small buildings identified in Step 3 by their district (column ""district"" in the 1808 Buildings Dataset). This will help us see which areas have a concentration of small buildings.

**Step 5: Check for clustering in each district**
We will examine each district to see if there is a significant concentration of small buildings. We can use the number of small buildings in each district to determine if they are clustered.

**Step 6: Compare with landmarks**
We will compare the districts with a high concentration of small buildings to the Landmarks Dataset to see if there are any notable landmarks in those areas that might be contributing to the clustering of small buildings.

**Step 7: Determine if small buildings are clustered in specific areas**
Based on the analysis in Steps 4-6, we will determine if small buildings with smaller than average building size are clustered in specific areas in 1808.

18,How many people live within 100 meters from the closest church in 1808?,spatial,a single number,1,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Load the datasets**
Load the three datasets: buildings_1740.csv, buildings_1808.csv, and landmarks.csv into a data analysis environment such as pandas in Python.

**Step 2: Identify the closest church in 1808**
Filter the landmarks.csv dataset to only include rows where landmark_type is ""church"" to get a list of all churches in Venice in 1808. This will be our reference dataset for finding the closest church to each building.

**Step 3: Calculate the distance between each building and the closest church in 1808**
Join the buildings_1808 dataset with the filtered church dataset from step 2 using the longitude and latitude columns. Use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between each building and its closest church. The Haversine formula will give us the distance in kilometers, so we'll need to convert it to meters.

**Step 4: Filter buildings within 100 meters from the closest church**
Filter the joined dataset from step 3 to only include rows where the distance between the building and its closest church is less than or equal to 100 meters.

**Step 5: Count the number of buildings within 100 meters from the closest church**

We will filter the merged dataset to include only the rows where the distance between the building and the nearest square is less than or equal to 100 meters. We can use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere (such as the Earth) given their longitudes and latitudes.

**Step 3: Filter the merged dataset to include only workshops**

We will filter the merged dataset to include only the rows where the building function is ""workshop"".

**Step 4: Calculate the average building area of workshops near the squares**

We will calculate the average building area of the workshops near the squares by taking the mean of the building_area column in the filtered dataset.

**Step 5: Calculate the average building area of workshops further away from the squares**

We will filter the original 1808 Buildings Dataset to include only the rows where the distance between the building and the nearest square is greater than 100 meters. We will then calculate the average building area of the workshops in this dataset.

**Step 6: Calculate the difference in average building area**

We will calculate the difference in average building area between the workshops near the squares and those further away from the squares.

**Step 7: Provide the final answer**

We will provide the final answer as the difference in average building area calculated in Step 6.

**Step 2: Filter the merged dataset to only include buildings near churches**

We will filter the merged dataset to only include buildings that are within 100 meters of a church. We will use the longitude and latitude columns to calculate the distance between each building and the nearest church.

**Step 3: Calculate the average rent price of buildings near churches**

We will calculate the average rent price of buildings that are near churches. This will give us the average rent price of workshops near churches.

**Step 4: Calculate the average rent price of buildings further away from churches**

We will filter the 1740 Buildings Dataset to only include buildings that are more than 100 meters away from any church. Then, we will calculate the average rent price of these buildings. This will give us the average rent price of workshops further away from churches.

**Step 5: Calculate the difference between the two average rent prices**

We will subtract the average rent price of buildings further away from churches from the average rent price of buildings near churches to find out how much more expensive workshops near churches are compared to those further away.

**Step 6: Round the result to the nearest integer**

We will round the result to the nearest integer to get the final answer.

**Step 7: Check for outliers and missing values**

We will check the merged dataset and the filtered datasets for any outliers or missing values that may affect the accuracy of our result. If any issues are found, we will either remove or impute the values accordingly.

**Step 1: Understand the question and datasets**
We need to find the number of buildings located around the square of San Marco within 100 meters in 1740. We have three datasets: Buildings 1740, Buildings 1808, and Landmarks. The Landmarks dataset contains information about the location of squares in Venice, including the square of San Marco.

**Step 2: Identify the location of San Marco square**
We need to find the longitude and latitude coordinates of the square of San Marco from the Landmarks dataset. We will look for the landmark with the name ""San Marco"" and extract its longitude and latitude values.

**Step 3: Filter the Buildings 1740 dataset to include only buildings within 100 meters of San Marco square**

**Step 4: Count the number of buildings within the buffer zone**
We will count the number of rows remaining in the filtered dataset from Step 3. This will give us the total number of buildings located around the square of San Marco within 100 meters in 1740.

**Step 1: Understand the Question**
We need to find the number of houses located around the church of Saint Paul within 100 meters in 1740. This requires identifying the church of Saint Paul's location and then finding all the buildings within a 100-meter radius.

**Step 2: Identify the Location of the Church of Saint Paul**
We need to find the longitude and latitude of the church of Saint Paul in the Landmarks dataset. We will look for the landmark_name ""Saint Paul"" and extract its corresponding longitude and latitude values.

**Step 3: Filter the Buildings Dataset (1740)**
We will filter the 1740 Buildings Dataset to only include rows where the building is within 100 meters of the church of Saint Paul. We will use the longitude and latitude values from the Landmarks dataset to create a spatial filter.

**Step 4: Check the Building Functions**
We will check the building_functions column in the filtered dataset to ensure that the buildings are classified as houses. We will count the number of rows where building_functions contains the word ""house"".

**Step 5: Count the Number of Houses**
We will count the number of rows that meet the conditions in step 4, which will give us the number of houses located around the church of Saint Paul within 100 meters in 1740.

**Step 6: Answer the Question**
We will provide the count of houses as the final answer.

**Step 1: Load the datasets**
Load the three datasets into a data analysis software or a programming language (e.g., Python using pandas library). This will allow us to access and manipulate the data.

**Step 2: Identify the location of San Marco square**
Locate the San Marco square in the Landmarks dataset and extract its longitude and latitude coordinates. We need to identify the exact location of the square to determine the surrounding buildings.

**Step 3: Filter the 1808 Buildings dataset**
Filter the 1808 Buildings dataset to only include buildings within a 100-meter radius of the San Marco square. We can use the longitude and latitude coordinates from Step 2 to create a spatial filter. This will give us a subset of buildings that are located around the square.

**Step 4: Identify the type of buildings**
In the filtered dataset from Step 3, identify the buildings that are houses. We can do this by checking the building_functions column for buildings that serve as ""residential"" or ""dwelling"" purposes.

**Step 5: Count the number of houses**
Count the number of buildings identified as houses in Step 4. This will give us the total number of houses located around the San Marco square within 100 meters in 1808.

**Step 1: Load the datasets**

* Load the 1740 Buildings Dataset (data/buildings_1740.csv) into a data frame.
* Load the Landmarks Dataset (data/landmarks.csv) into a separate data frame.
* Identify the row in the Landmarks Dataset that corresponds to San Marco (landmark_name = ""San Marco"").

**Step 2: Filter the buildings within 100 meters from San Marco in 1740**

* Extract the longitude and latitude of San Marco from the Landmarks Dataset.
* Filter the 1740 Buildings Dataset to include only the rows where the building's distance from San Marco is less than or equal to 100 meters. This can be done using the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere (in this case, the Earth).

**Step 3: Calculate the average rent price of buildings within 100 meters from San Marco in 1740**

* Calculate the average rent price of the filtered buildings from Step 2.

**Step 4: Filter the buildings within 100 meters from other squares in 1740**

* Filter the Landmarks Dataset to include only the rows where the landmark_type is ""square"" and the landmark_name is not ""San Marco"".
* For each of these squares, extract the longitude and latitude.
* Filter the 1740 Buildings Dataset to include only the rows where the building's distance from any of these squares is less than or equal to 100 meters.

**Step 5: Calculate the average rent price of buildings within 100 meters from other squares in 1740**

* Calculate the average rent price of the filtered buildings from Step 4.

**Step 6: Compare the average rent prices**

* Compare the average rent price of buildings within 100 meters from San Marco (from Step 3) with the average rent price of buildings within 100 meters from other squares (from Step 5).
* If the average rent price of buildings within 100 meters from San Marco is greater than the average rent price of buildings within 100 meters from other squares, the answer is yes. Otherwise, the answer is no.

**Step 7: Final answer**

* Based on the comparison in Step 6, provide the final answer in the format of yes or no.","import pandas as pd

**Step 1: Filter the 1808 Buildings Dataset to get buildings within 100 meters from San Marco**

* Load the 1808 Buildings Dataset into a data frame.
* Filter the data frame to include only the rows where the building is located within 100 meters from San Marco. This can be done by adding a condition to the data frame where the latitude and longitude of the building are within 0.0001 degrees (which is approximately 100 meters) of the latitude and longitude of San Marco.
* San Marco's coordinates are approximately 45.4343° N, 12.3392° E. We will use these coordinates to filter the data.

**Step 2: Filter the 1808 Buildings Dataset to get buildings within 100 meters from other squares**

* Load the Landmarks Dataset into a data frame.
* Filter the data frame to include only the rows where the landmark_type is ""square"".
* Extract the coordinates of these squares.
* Filter the 1808 Buildings Dataset to include only the rows where the building is located within 100 meters from any of the squares. This can be done by adding a condition to the data frame where the latitude and longitude of the building are within 0.0001 degrees of the latitude and longitude of each square.

**Step 3: Calculate the average building area of buildings within 100 meters from San Marco and other squares**

* Calculate the average building area of the buildings within 100 meters from San Marco.
* Calculate the average building area of the buildings within 100 meters from other squares.

**Step 4: Compare the average building areas**

* Compare the two average building areas calculated in Step 3.
* If the average building area of the buildings within 100 meters from San Marco is greater than the average building area of the buildings within 100 meters from other squares, the answer is ""yes"".
* If the average building area of the buildings within 100 meters from San Marco is not greater than the average building area of the buildings within 100 meters from other squares, the answer is ""no"".

**Step 1: Load the datasets**

* Load the 1740 Buildings Dataset (data/buildings_1740.csv) into a data frame.
* Load the Landmarks Dataset (data/landmarks.csv) into a separate data frame.

**Step 2: Filter the datasets**

* From the 1740 Buildings Dataset, filter the rows where the building is not a landmark (i.e., the building is not a church or a square).
* From the Landmarks Dataset, filter the rows where the landmark type is ""square"".

**Step 3: Calculate the distances**

* Calculate the distance between each building (from the filtered 1740 Buildings Dataset) and each square (from the filtered Landmarks Dataset) using the longitude and latitude coordinates.
* Use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere (in this case, the Earth).

**Step 4: Group the data**

* Group the data by building owner's family name and calculate the average distance to the nearest square for each group.

**Step 5: Calculate the overall average distance**

* Calculate the overall average distance from all buildings to the nearest square.

**Step 6: Answer the question**

* The final answer will be the overall average distance calculated in Step 5.

**Step 1: Load the datasets**
Load the three datasets: buildings_1740.csv, buildings_1808.csv, and landmarks.csv into a data analysis environment such as pandas in Python.

**Step 2: Filter the 1808 Buildings Dataset**
Filter the buildings_1808.csv dataset to only include rows where the building_function is ""square"" (assuming a square is a type of building function). This will give us the coordinates of the squares in 1808.

**Step 3: Extract Square Coordinates**
Extract the longitude and latitude columns from the filtered dataset to get the coordinates of the squares in 1808.

**Step 4: Filter the 1808 Buildings Dataset**
Filter the buildings_1808.csv dataset to only include rows where the building_function is not ""square"" (i.e., exclude squares). This will give us the coordinates of the non-square buildings in 1808.

**Step 5: Calculate Distance from Squares**
Calculate the distance between each non-square building and the closest square in 1808 using the Haversine formula or a similar method. This will give us the distance of each non-square building from the nearest square.

**Step 6: Calculate Average Distance**
Calculate the average distance of all non-square buildings from the nearest square in 1808.

**Step 7: Round and Format Answer**
Round the average distance to a single decimal place and format the answer as a numerical value.

41,Which neighborhood has the highest density of different families in 1740?,spatial,a single entity name,0,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Understand the Question**
We need to find the neighborhood (parish) with the highest density of different families in Venice in 1740.

**Step 2: Identify Relevant Data**
We will use the 1740 Buildings Dataset (data/buildings_1740.csv) to find the number of unique families (owner_family_name) in each parish (parish).

**Step 3: Count Unique Families per Parish**
We will use the ""owner_family_name"" column to count the number of unique families in each parish. We will create a new column ""unique_families_count"" to store this count.

**Step 4: Calculate Density**
We will calculate the density of different families in each parish by dividing the count of unique families (unique_families_count) by the total number of buildings in each parish (i.e., the number of rows in the dataset for each parish).

**Step 5: Find the Parish with the Highest Density**
We will identify the parish with the highest density of different families.

**Step 6: Extract the Answer**
We will extract the name of the parish with the highest density of different families.

**Step 7: Provide the Final Answer**
We will provide the name of the parish with the highest density of different families as the final answer.

Note: We will assume that the density is calculated as the number of unique families per building, i.e., the ratio of unique families to the total number of buildings in each parish.","import pandas as pd

42,Which neighborhood has the highest density of different families in 1808?,spatial,a single entity name,0,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Understand the Question**
We need to find the neighborhood with the highest density of different families in 1808. This means we have to identify the neighborhoods and calculate the number of unique families in each neighborhood.

**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Datasets**
We will use the 1808 Buildings Dataset (data/buildings_1808.csv) to find the number of unique families in each neighborhood.

**Step 3: Filter the Data**
From the 1808 Buildings Dataset, we will filter the data to only include the columns that are relevant to our analysis: `district` (neighborhood) and `owner_family_name` (family name of the building owner).

**Step 4: Count Unique Families per Neighborhood**
We will group the data by `district` and count the number of unique `owner_family_name` values for each group. This will give us the number of unique families in each neighborhood.

**Step 5: Calculate Density of Families per Neighborhood**
We will calculate the density of families per neighborhood by dividing the number of unique families by the total number of buildings in each neighborhood.

**Step 6: Find the Neighborhood with the Highest Density**
We will identify the neighborhood with the highest density of families.

**Step 7: Extract the Answer**

43,How many churches does each parish have on average in 1740?,spatial,a single number,1,0,"Here is a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Load the 1740 Buildings Dataset**
 Load the ""data/buildings_1740.csv"" dataset into a data analysis tool or software, such as pandas in Python. This will allow us to access and manipulate the data.

**Step 2: Filter the Dataset to Only Include Churches**
 Filter the dataset to only include rows where the building functions include the word ""church"". This can be done by using a conditional statement to check if the ""building_functions"" column contains the word ""church"". The resulting dataset will only include buildings that are churches.

**Step 3: Group the Dataset by Parish**
 Group the filtered dataset by the ""parish"" column. This will create a new dataset with the parish as the groupby variable, and each group will contain the number of churches in that parish.

**Step 4: Calculate the Average Number of Churches per Parish**
 Calculate the average number of churches per parish by dividing the total number of churches in each group by the number of groups (i.e., the number of parishes). This will give us the average number of churches per parish.

**Step 5: Extract the Result**
 Extract the result from the previous step, which should be a single numerical value representing the average number of churches per parish in 1740.

45,Is there a significant difference in the rent prices for buildings within 100 meters from the closest churches versus from squares in 1740?,spatial,yes or no,2,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Load the datasets**

* Load the 1740 Buildings Dataset (data/buildings_1740.csv) into a data frame.
* Load the Landmarks Dataset (data/landmarks.csv) into a separate data frame.

**Step 2: Filter the datasets**

* Filter the 1740 Buildings Dataset to include only rows where the building is within 100 meters from a landmark (church or square).
* To do this, we'll use the longitude and latitude columns from both datasets to calculate the distance between each building and the closest landmark. We can use the Haversine formula or a library function to calculate the distance.

**Step 3: Join the datasets**

* Join the filtered 1740 Buildings Dataset with the Landmarks Dataset on the longitude and latitude columns to identify the closest landmark (church or square) for each building.

**Step 4: Group and aggregate the data**

* Group the joined dataset by the landmark type (church or square) and calculate the average rent price for buildings within 100 meters of each type of landmark.

**Step 5: Compare the average rent prices**

* Compare the average rent prices for buildings within 100 meters of churches and squares to determine if there is a significant difference.

**Step 6: Determine the final answer**

* If the absolute difference between the two average rent prices is greater than a certain threshold (e.g., 10%), answer is yes. Otherwise, answer is no.

**Step 1: Load the 1740 Buildings Dataset**

* Import the 1740 Buildings Dataset into a data analysis software (e.g. Pandas in Python) and store it in a dataframe called `buildings_1740`.

**Step 2: Filter Buildings with Multiple Functions**

* Identify rows in `buildings_1740` where `building_functions_count` is greater than 1, indicating buildings with multiple functions.
* Store the filtered dataframe in a new dataframe called `multiple_function_buildings`.

**Step 3: Group by Parish and Count Buildings**

* Group the `multiple_function_buildings` dataframe by `parish` and count the number of buildings in each parish.
* Store the result in a new dataframe called `parish_counts`.

**Step 4: Calculate Density of Buildings with Multiple Functions**

* Calculate the density of buildings with multiple functions in each parish by dividing the count of buildings with multiple functions by the total number of buildings in each parish.
* This will require joining the `parish_counts` dataframe with the original `buildings_1740` dataframe on the `parish` column.
* Store the result in a new dataframe called `density`.

**Step 5: Find the Parish with the Highest Density**

* Identify the parish with the highest density of buildings with multiple functions from the `density` dataframe.
* This will require using a function to find the maximum value in the `density` column.

58,What is the average size difference between the districts with the largest and the smalles buildings in 1808?,spatial,a single number,0,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Load the 1808 Buildings Dataset**

* Import the 1808 Buildings Dataset into a data analysis software or programming environment, such as pandas in Python.
* Ensure that the dataset is loaded correctly and all columns are accessible.

**Step 2: Filter the Dataset to Get the Largest and Smallest Buildings**

* Select the 'building_area' column from the dataset.
* Find the maximum and minimum building areas in the dataset. This will give us the area of the largest and smallest buildings.
* Use these values to filter the dataset and get the rows corresponding to the largest and smallest buildings.

**Step 3: Extract the Districts of the Largest and Smallest Buildings**

* For the largest building, extract the 'district' column value from the filtered row.
* For the smallest building, extract the 'district' column value from the filtered row.
* Store these district values in separate variables for later use.

**Step 4: Calculate the Average Building Area in Each District**

* Group the original dataset by the 'district' column.
* Calculate the average building area for each district.
* Store these average values in a new dataset or a dictionary.

**Step 5: Find the Average Size Difference**

* Find the average building area for the district of the largest building and the average building area for the district of the smallest building.
* Calculate the absolute difference between these two average values.
* This will give us the average size difference between the districts with the largest and smallest buildings.

**Step 6: Provide the Final Answer**

**Step 1: Load the 1740 Buildings Dataset**

* Import the 1740 Buildings Dataset into a data analysis software or programming environment, such as pandas in Python.
* Ensure that the dataset is loaded correctly and all columns are accessible.

**Step 2: Group the Data by Parish and Owner Family Name**

* Use the `groupby` function to group the dataset by the 'parish' column and the 'owner_family_name' column.
* This will create a new dataframe with the parish as the index and the owner family name as the column header.

**Step 3: Count the Number of Buildings per Parish and Owner Family Name**

* Use the `size` function to count the number of rows (i.e., buildings) for each group.
* This will create a new dataframe with the parish as the index and the count of buildings as the value.

**Step 4: Filter the Data to Find Parishes with More Than 5 Buildings Owned by a Single Family**

* Use the `loc` function to filter the dataframe to include only the rows where the count of buildings is greater than 5.
* This will create a new dataframe with only the parishes that have more than 5 buildings owned by a single family.

**Step 5: Check if the Filtered Dataframe is Not Empty**

* Use the `not empty` function to check if the filtered dataframe is not empty.
* If the dataframe is not empty, then the answer to the question is ""yes"".

* Load the Landmarks Dataset (data/landmarks.csv) into another data frame.

**Step 2: Preprocess the 1740 Buildings Dataset**

* Split the 'building_functions' column in the 1740 Buildings Dataset into individual functions by splitting the comma-separated string into a list of values.
* Create a new column 'function_count' in the 1740 Buildings Dataset by counting the number of functions for each building.

**Step 3: Calculate the diversity of building functions**

* Calculate the diversity of building functions for each building in the 1740 Buildings Dataset by using a diversity metric such as the Shannon entropy or the Gini coefficient.
* Create a new column 'function_diversity' in the 1740 Buildings Dataset with the calculated diversity values.

**Step 4: Filter buildings within 100 meters radius**

* Use the 'longitude' and 'latitude' columns in the 1740 Buildings Dataset to calculate the distance of each building from a given landmark (square) using the Haversine formula.
* Filter the 1740 Buildings Dataset to include only buildings within a 100 meters radius of the given landmark (square).

**Step 5: Aggregate building function diversity**

* Group the filtered 1740 Buildings Dataset by the 'parish' column and calculate the average 'function_diversity' for each parish.
* Sort the resulting data frame in descending order by 'function_diversity' and select the top parish with the highest average function diversity.

**Step 6: Match the parish with the landmark**

* Use the 'landmark_name' column in the Landmarks Dataset to find the landmark (square) that corresponds to the parish with the highest average function diversity.
* Return the name of the landmark (square) as the answer.

64,Which square is surrounded with the buildings with the most diverse functions within the radius of 100 meters in 1808?,function,a single entity name,1,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Load the datasets**

* Load the 1808 Buildings Dataset into a data frame for further analysis.
* Load the Landmarks Dataset into a separate data frame for further analysis.

**Step 2: Preprocess the data**

* For the 1808 Buildings Dataset, convert the 'building_functions' column into a list of functions per row, if it's not already in list format.
* For the 1808 Buildings Dataset, convert the 'building_functions' list into a list of unique functions per row, and then calculate the number of unique functions for each building.

**Step 3: Calculate the diversity of building functions**

* For each building in the 1808 Buildings Dataset, calculate the diversity of building functions by dividing the number of unique functions by the total number of functions (building_functions_count). This will give us a diversity score for each building.
* This diversity score will be a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 1 means the building has only one function, and 0 means the building has as many unique functions as it has total functions.

**Step 4: Filter buildings within the 100-meter radius**

* For each landmark in the Landmarks Dataset, filter the 1808 Buildings Dataset to include only buildings that are within a 100-meter radius from the landmark.
* Use the longitude and latitude columns to calculate the distance between each building and the landmark using the Haversine formula or a similar method.

**Step 5: Calculate the average diversity score**

* For each landmark, calculate the average diversity score of the buildings within the 100-meter radius.
* This will give us a single diversity score for each landmark.

**Step 6: Find the landmark with the highest average diversity score**

* Sort the landmarks by their average diversity score in descending order.
* The landmark with the highest average diversity score is the one surrounded by buildings with the most diverse functions within the 100-meter radius in 1808.

**Step 7: Return the landmark name**

* Return the name of the landmark with the highest average diversity score as the final answer.

This plan should lead us to the correct answer, which is the name of the square surrounded by buildings with the most diverse functions within the 100-meter radius in 1808.","import pandas as pd

66,Are residential buildings more closely located to the squares than commercial buildings in 1808?,function,yes or no,3,1,"Here is a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Understand the datasets**
We need to familiarize ourselves with the three datasets provided: buildings_1740, buildings_1808, and landmarks. We should note the columns and their meanings in each dataset.

**Step 2: Identify relevant columns in buildings_1808 dataset**
We need to identify the columns that will help us determine if residential buildings are more closely located to squares than commercial buildings. Specifically, we need to focus on the columns ""building_functions"", ""longitude"", and ""latitude"" in the buildings_1808 dataset.

**Step 3: Extract building functions**
We need to extract the building functions from the ""building_functions"" column in the buildings_1808 dataset. This column contains a list of functions, so we need to determine which ones are residential and which ones are commercial.

**Step 4: Identify residential and commercial functions**
We need to categorize the building functions into residential and commercial. For example, residential functions might include ""dwelling"", ""residence"", etc., while commercial functions might include ""shop"", ""store"", ""office"", etc.

**Step 5: Calculate distances between buildings and squares**
We need to calculate the distances between each building in the buildings_1808 dataset and the nearest square in the landmarks dataset using the ""longitude"" and ""latitude"" columns.

**Step 6: Group buildings by function and calculate average distance**
We need to group the buildings by their function (residential or commercial) and calculate the average distance from each group to the nearest square.

**Step 7: Compare average distances**
We need to compare the average distances between residential and commercial buildings to determine if residential buildings are more closely located to squares than commercial buildings.

**Step 8: Determine the answer**
If the average distance from residential buildings to the nearest square is less than the average distance from commercial buildings to the nearest square, then the answer is yes. Otherwise, the answer is no.

* Load the 1740 Buildings Dataset (data/buildings_1740.csv) into a data frame.
* Load the Landmarks Dataset (data/landmarks.csv) into a separate data frame.

**Step 2: Prepare the data**

* From the 1740 Buildings Dataset, create a new column that calculates the Euclidean distance between each building and the nearest landmark (square or church) in the Landmarks Dataset. This can be done by using the longitude and latitude coordinates of both datasets.
* Since the Landmarks Dataset only contains squares and churches, we will use this as a proxy for ""squares"" in the calculation.

**Step 3: Calculate the distance**

* For each building in the 1740 Buildings Dataset, find the nearest landmark by calculating the Euclidean distance between the building's coordinates and the landmark's coordinates. This can be done using a library such as scikit-learn or scipy.
* Calculate the average of these distances across all buildings.

**Step 4: Filter the data**

* Since we are only interested in the distance between houses and squares, we will filter out buildings that are not located near a square (i.e., buildings near churches).

71,What is the average distance between houses and their nearest square in 1808?,function,a single number,2,1,"Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Merge the 1808 Buildings Dataset with the Landmarks Dataset**

First, we need to combine the 1808 Buildings Dataset and the Landmarks Dataset to find the nearest square for each building. We will do this by matching the longitude and latitude coordinates of the buildings with the landmarks. We can use the Haversine distance formula to calculate the distance between each building and each landmark. However, since we're looking for the nearest square, we'll only consider landmarks that are squares.

**Step 2: Calculate the Haversine distance between each building and each landmark**

Next, we'll calculate the Haversine distance between each building in the 1808 Buildings Dataset and each landmark in the Landmarks Dataset. We'll use the longitude and latitude coordinates to calculate the distance.

**Step 3: Identify the nearest square for each building**

We'll then identify the landmark (square) that is closest to each building. This can be done by finding the landmark with the smallest Haversine distance for each building.

**Step 4: Calculate the average distance**

Once we have the nearest square for each building, we'll calculate the average distance between each building and its nearest square. This can be done by taking the average of the Haversine distances calculated in Step 2.

**Step 5: Filter out buildings with no nearest square**

Since we're looking for the average distance between houses and their nearest square, we'll only consider buildings that have a nearest square. If a building does not have a nearest square (e.g., if it's too far away from any square), we'll exclude it from the average calculation.

**Step 6: Calculate the final average distance**

Finally, we'll calculate the average distance between houses and their nearest square, excluding any buildings without a nearest square.

**Step 7: Round the result**

We'll round the final average distance to two decimal places.

**Step 1: Load the 1740 Buildings Dataset**

* Import the 1740 Buildings Dataset into a data analysis software or programming environment, such as pandas in Python.
* Ensure that the dataset is loaded correctly and all columns are properly aligned.

**Step 2: Filter Multi-Functional Buildings**

* Identify rows in the dataset where the building serves more than one function, i.e., building_functions_count > 1.
* These rows represent multi-functional buildings.
* Store these rows in a new dataframe or a separate dataset for further analysis.

**Step 3: Extract Function Combinations**

* From the filtered dataset, extract the unique combinations of building functions for each multi-functional building.
* Since the building_functions column is a comma-separated list, we will need to split this column into separate rows for each function.
* Use a technique such as string splitting or tokenization to achieve this.

**Step 4: Count Function Combinations**

* Count the frequency of each function combination in the extracted list.
* Use a technique such as grouping or aggregation to achieve this.

**Step 5: Find the Most Common Combination**

* Identify the function combination with the highest frequency count.
* This will be the most common combination of functions for multi-functional buildings in 1740.

77,Is there a correlation between building functions and their proximity to the churches in 1740?,function,yes or no,1,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to analyze the question and provide an answer:

**Step 1: Understand the Question**
We need to determine if there is a correlation between the building functions and their proximity to churches in 1740. This means we want to find out if buildings with certain functions are more likely to be located near churches.

**Step 2: Prepare the Data**
We will start by loading the 1740 Buildings Dataset and the Landmarks Dataset into a data analysis environment. We will focus on the columns that contain the building functions and the location of the buildings and landmarks.

**Step 3: Identify Church Locations**
From the Landmarks Dataset, we will extract the longitude and latitude coordinates of the churches. We will store these coordinates in a separate dataframe or table for easy reference.

**Step 4: Calculate Proximity to Churches**
For each building in the 1740 Buildings Dataset, we will calculate its proximity to the nearest church using the longitude and latitude coordinates. We can use a distance calculation formula, such as the Haversine formula, to determine the distance between each building and the nearest church.

**Step 5: Group Buildings by Function**
We will group the buildings by their functions (building_functions) and calculate the average distance to the nearest church for each group. This will give us an idea of how close buildings with different functions are to churches on average.

**Step 6: Analyze Correlation**
We will compare the average distances to the nearest church for each group of buildings with different functions. If we find that buildings with certain functions are consistently closer to churches than others, it may indicate a correlation between building functions and proximity to churches.

**Step 7: Draw Conclusion**
Based on the analysis, we will determine if there is a correlation between building functions and their proximity to churches in 1740. If the average distances to the nearest church vary significantly across different building functions, we can conclude that there is a correlation. Otherwise, we will conclude that there is no correlation.

**Step 8: Answer the Question**
Finally, we will answer the question with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" based on our analysis. If there is a correlation, we will identify the specific building functions that are more likely to be located near churches.","import pandas as pd

81,Is there a correlation between the number of building functions and the rent price in 1740?,function,yes or no,0,0,"Here is a step-by-step plan to analyze the question and provide an answer:

**Step 1: Understand the Question**
We need to determine if there is a correlation between the number of building functions and the rent price in 1740. This means we want to see if there is a relationship between the building_functions_count and rent_price columns in the 1740 Buildings Dataset.

**Step 2: Explore the Data**
Before analyzing the correlation, we need to explore the distribution of the building_functions_count and rent_price columns in the 1740 Buildings Dataset. We will check for any missing values, outliers, and data types to ensure that the data is clean and suitable for analysis.

**Step 3: Visualize the Data**
We will create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between building_functions_count and rent_price. This will give us an initial idea of whether there is a correlation between the two variables.

**Step 4: Calculate the Correlation Coefficient**
We will calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between building_functions_count and rent_price using the 1740 Buildings Dataset. The correlation coefficient will range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation). A correlation coefficient close to 0 indicates no correlation.

**Step 5: Interpret the Results**
We will interpret the correlation coefficient to determine if there is a significant correlation between the number of building functions and the rent price in 1740. If the correlation coefficient is close to 0, we will conclude that there is no correlation. If the correlation coefficient is close to 1 or -1, we will conclude that there is a strong correlation.

**Step 6: Draw a Conclusion**
Based on the results, we will answer the question with either ""yes"" or ""no"", indicating whether there is a correlation between the number of building functions and the rent price in 1740.","import pandas as pd

82,Is there a correlation between the number of building functions and the size of the building in 1808?,function,yes or no,0,0,"Here is a step-by-step plan to analyze the question and provide an answer:

**Step 1: Understand the Question**
We need to determine if there is a correlation between the number of building functions and the size of the building in 1808. This means we want to see if there is a statistical relationship between the building_functions_count and building_area columns in the 1808 Buildings Dataset.

**Step 2: Prepare the Data**
Load the 1808 Buildings Dataset into a data analysis software or programming language (e.g., Python, R, or Excel). Ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis.

**Step 3: Explore the Data**
Take a look at the distribution of the building_functions_count and building_area columns to understand their range and variability. This will help us determine if there are any obvious correlations or patterns.

**Step 4: Calculate the Correlation Coefficient**
Use a statistical method (e.g., Pearson's r) to calculate the correlation coefficient between the building_functions_count and building_area columns. This will give us a numerical value that indicates the strength and direction of the correlation.

**Step 5: Interpret the Results**
Interpret the correlation coefficient value. A value close to 1 or -1 indicates a strong correlation, while a value close to 0 indicates no correlation. If the correlation coefficient is significant (e.g., p-value < 0.05), we can conclude that there is a statistically significant correlation between the two variables.

**Step 6: Visualize the Data (Optional)**
Create a scatter plot or histogram to visualize the relationship between building_functions_count and building_area. This can help us better understand the nature of the correlation and identify any patterns or outliers.

**Step 7: Answer the Question**
Based on the correlation coefficient value and the interpretation of the results, answer the question with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"". If the correlation coefficient is significant and suggests a positive or negative relationship, answer ""yes"". Otherwise, answer ""no"".

**Answer Format**
The final answer should be in the format of ""yes"" or ""no"".","import pandas as pd

**Step 1: Load the 1740 Buildings Dataset**

* Import the 1740 Buildings Dataset into a data analysis software or programming environment, such as pandas in Python.
* Ensure that the dataset is loaded correctly and all columns are properly aligned.

**Step 2: Group the Data by Parish**

* Use the `groupby` function to group the data by the ""parish"" column.
* This will create a new dataframe with the parish as the index and the other columns as values.

**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Buildings per Parish**

* Use the `size` function to calculate the number of buildings per parish.
* This will give us a series with the parish as the index and the count of buildings as the value.

**Step 4: Group the Data by Parish and Owner Family Name**

* Use the `groupby` function again to group the data by both the ""parish"" and ""owner_family_name"" columns.
* This will create a new dataframe with the parish and owner family name as the index and the other columns as values.

**Step 5: Calculate the Average Number of Buildings per Parish per Owner Family**

* Use the `mean` function to calculate the average number of buildings per parish per owner family.
* This will give us a series with the parish and owner family name as the index and the average count of buildings as the value.

**Step 6: Find the Owner Family with the Highest Average Number of Buildings per Parish**

* Use the `idxmax` function to find the index of the row with the highest average count of buildings.
* This will give us the owner family name with the highest average number of buildings per parish.

**Step 7: Extract the Owner Family Name**

* Use the `iloc` function to extract the owner family name from the index.
* This will give us the final answer, which is the owner family name with the highest average number of buildings per parish.

Next, we will filter the merged dataset to only include rows where the 'owner_first_name' and 'owner_family_name' are the same as the corresponding columns in the Landmarks Dataset. This will give us a list of buildings owned by the same family.

**Step 3: Extract the building functions for each building owned by the same family**

We will then extract the 'building_functions' column from the filtered dataset to get a list of building functions for each building owned by the same family.

**Step 4: Count the frequency of each building function**

We will count the frequency of each building function across all the buildings owned by the same family. This will give us a count of how many buildings are used for each function.

**Step 5: Identify the most common building function**

We will identify the building function with the highest count from the previous step. This will be the most common building function of buildings owned by the same family in 1808.

**Step 6: Extract the most common building function**

We will extract the most common building function from the previous step and provide it as the final answer.

The final answer will be in the format of a single textual entity name, which is the most common building function of buildings owned by the same family in 1808.","import pandas as pd

108,How many people were relocated by more than 1km from 1740 to 1808?,comparison,a single number,0,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to merge the two datasets to create a single dataset that contains information about each building in both 1740 and 1808. We will do this by matching the buildings based on their unique identifier, which in this case is the combination of owner_first_name, owner_family_name, and building_functions. However, since this combination is not unique in both datasets, we will use the combination of owner_first_name, owner_family_name, and longitude, latitude as the unique identifier.

**Step 2: Calculate the Distance Between 1740 and 1808 Locations**

Next, we will calculate the distance between the locations of each building in 1740 and 1808 using the longitude and latitude coordinates. We will use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance in kilometers.

**Step 3: Identify Buildings with a Distance of More Than 1km**

We will then filter the merged dataset to only include buildings that have a distance of more than 1km between their 1740 and 1808 locations.

**Step 4: Count the Number of Buildings with a Distance of More Than 1km**

Finally, we will count the number of buildings that meet the condition of having a distance of more than 1km between their 1740 and 1808 locations. This will give us the number of people who were relocated by more than 1km.

**Step 5: Output the Final Answer**

110,How many more buildings does the family of Michiel own in 1808 compared to 1740?,comparison,a single number,1,1,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Load the datasets**
Load the three datasets into a data analysis software or a programming language (e.g., Python using pandas library). Ensure that all datasets are properly formatted and easily accessible.

**Step 2: Filter the datasets**
Filter the 1740 Buildings Dataset to extract only the rows where the owner_family_name is 'Michiel'. This will give us the number of buildings owned by the Michiel family in 1740.

**Step 3: Filter the 1808 Buildings Dataset**
Filter the 1808 Buildings Dataset to extract only the rows where the owner_family_name is 'Michiel'. This will give us the number of buildings owned by the Michiel family in 1808.

**Step 4: Count the number of buildings**
Count the number of rows in each filtered dataset from steps 2 and 3. This will give us the total number of buildings owned by the Michiel family in 1740 and 1808, respectively.

**Step 5: Calculate the difference**
Subtract the number of buildings owned by the Michiel family in 1740 from the number of buildings owned by the Michiel family in 1808. This will give us the difference in the number of buildings owned by the Michiel family between the two time periods.

111,Which profession exhibited the highest rate of relocation compared to others from 1740 to 1808?,comparison,a single entity name,0,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to merge the two datasets to compare the professions of building owners in 1740 and 1808. We will use the `owner_first_name` and `owner_family_name` columns as keys to match the owners.

**Step 2: Filter Out Non-Matching Owners**

Since not all owners in 1740 may have built or owned a building in 1808, we need to filter out the owners who do not have a match in both datasets. We will use the `owner_first_name` and `owner_family_name` columns to identify matching owners.

**Step 3: Count the Number of Buildings Owned by Each Profession in 1740 and 1808**

We need to count the number of buildings owned by each profession in both 1740 and 1808. We will use the `owner_profession` column in the 1740 dataset and the `owner_first_name` and `owner_family_name` columns to match with the 1808 dataset.

**Step 4: Calculate the Rate of Relocation for Each Profession**

We need to calculate the rate of relocation for each profession by dividing the number of buildings owned by each profession in 1808 by the number of buildings owned by that profession in 1740.

**Step 5: Identify the Profession with the Highest Rate of Relocation**

We need to identify the profession with the highest rate of relocation. This will be the profession that has the highest ratio of buildings owned in 1808 to buildings owned in 1740.

**Step 6: Determine the Final Answer**

The final answer will be the profession with the highest rate of relocation. We will select this profession from the results of Step 5.

113,How many families relocated their buildings closer to squares from 1740 to 1808?,comparison,a single number,1,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to merge the two datasets to compare the locations of buildings in 1740 and 1808. We can do this by matching the building owners' names and addresses (longitude and latitude) between the two datasets.

**Step 2: Identify Buildings with a Change in Location**

Next, we need to identify the buildings that have a change in location between 1740 and 1808. We can do this by comparing the longitude and latitude values between the two datasets. We will consider a building as relocated if the difference in longitude or latitude is greater than a certain threshold (e.g., 0.01 degrees).

**Step 3: Filter Buildings with a Change in Location**

We will filter the merged dataset to only include buildings that have a change in location.

**Step 4: Identify Buildings near Squares in 1740**

We will join the filtered dataset with the Landmarks dataset to identify the buildings that were located near squares in 1740. We can do this by checking if the building's location is within a certain distance (e.g., 0.1 degrees) from any square landmark.

**Step 5: Identify Buildings near Squares in 1808**

We will join the filtered dataset with the Landmarks dataset again to identify the buildings that were located near squares in 1808.

**Step 6: Count Families with a Change in Location towards Squares**

We will count the number of families that relocated their buildings from a non-square location to a location near a square between 1740 and 1808. We will do this by comparing the number of buildings near squares in 1740 and 1808 for each family.

**Step 7: Calculate the Final Answer**

114,How many families relocated their buildings further away from squares from 1740 to 1808?,comparison,a single number,1,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to merge the two datasets to compare the locations of buildings in 1740 and 1808. We can do this by matching the building owners' names and addresses (longitude and latitude) between the two datasets.

**Step 2: Identify Squares in the Landmarks Dataset**

Next, we need to identify the squares in the Landmarks Dataset. We can do this by filtering the dataset to only include rows where landmark_type is ""square"".

**Step 3: Calculate the Distance Between Buildings and Squares in 1740**

We need to calculate the distance between each building in the merged dataset (from step 1) and the squares identified in step 2. We can use the longitude and latitude columns to calculate the distance using the Haversine formula or a similar method.

**Step 4: Filter Buildings that are Close to Squares in 1740**

We need to filter the merged dataset to only include buildings that are close to a square in 1740. We can define ""close"" as a distance threshold, for example, 100 meters.

**Step 5: Merge the Filtered Dataset with the 1808 Dataset**

We need to merge the filtered dataset from step 4 with the 1808 Buildings Dataset to compare the locations of the same buildings in 1808.

**Step 6: Calculate the Distance Between Buildings and Squares in 1808**

We need to calculate the distance between each building in the merged dataset (from step 5) and the squares identified in step 2. We can use the longitude and latitude columns to calculate the distance using the Haversine formula or a similar method.

**Step 7: Filter Buildings that are Not Close to Squares in 1808**

We need to filter the merged dataset to only include buildings that are not close to a square in 1808. We can define ""not close"" as the opposite of the distance threshold used in step 4, for example, more than 100 meters.

**Step 8: Count the Number of Families**

We need to count the number of unique families (owner_first_name and owner_family_name) that relocated their buildings further away from squares from 1740 to 1808. We can do this by counting the number of unique families in the filtered dataset from step 7.

**Step 9: Return the Count**

Finally, we need to return the count of families that relocated their buildings further away from squares from 1740 to 1808.","import pandas as pd

* Load the 1740 Buildings Dataset (data/buildings_1740.csv) into a data frame.
* Load the 1808 Buildings Dataset (data/buildings_1808.csv) into a separate data frame.
* Load the Landmarks Dataset (data/landmarks.csv) into another data frame.

**Step 2: Filter the Landmarks dataset to only include squares**

* Select only the rows from the Landmarks dataset where landmark_type is ""square"".
* This will give us a subset of squares in Venice.

**Step 3: Calculate the distance between each building and the closest square in 1740**

* Use the longitude and latitude columns to calculate the distance between each building in the 1740 Buildings dataset and the closest square in the filtered Landmarks dataset.
* Use a suitable distance calculation method (e.g. Haversine distance) to calculate the distance.
* Create a new column in the 1740 Buildings dataset to store the calculated distance.

**Step 4: Filter the 1740 Buildings dataset to include only buildings within 100 meters of a square**

* Use the new distance column to filter the 1740 Buildings dataset to include only buildings within 100 meters of a square.
* Count the number of buildings in this filtered dataset.

**Step 2: Filter the merged dataset to only include rows where the building is present in both 1740 and 1808**

We need to find the rows where the `owner_first_name` and `owner_family_name` appear in both datasets. This will give us the families that exist in both time periods.

**Step 3: Count the number of unique families**

**Step 1: Load the datasets**
Load the three datasets into a data analysis software or a programming language (e.g., Python using pandas library). Ensure that all datasets are properly formatted and easily accessible.

**Step 2: Filter the datasets**
Filter the 1740 Buildings Dataset to extract only the rows where the owner_family_name is 'Michiel'. This will give us the number of buildings owned by the Michiel family in 1740.

**Step 3: Filter the 1808 Buildings Dataset**
Filter the 1808 Buildings Dataset to extract only the rows where the owner_family_name is 'Michiel'. This will give us the number of buildings owned by the Michiel family in 1808.

**Step 4: Count the number of buildings**
Count the number of rows in each filtered dataset from steps 2 and 3. This will give us the total number of buildings owned by the Michiel family in 1740 and 1808, respectively.

**Step 5: Calculate the difference**
Subtract the number of buildings owned by the Michiel family in 1740 from the number of buildings owned by the Michiel family in 1808. This will give us the difference in the number of buildings owned by the Michiel family between the two time periods.

123,Which family increased the number of buildings they owned the most from 1740 to 1808?,comparison,a single entity name,0,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to merge the two datasets to compare the number of buildings owned by each family in both years. We can do this by matching the owner_first_name and owner_family_name columns in both datasets. Since the columns are likely to have some variation in formatting (e.g., different capitalization, punctuation), we may need to perform some data cleaning steps before merging.

**Step 2: Clean and Prepare the Merged Dataset**

After merging the datasets, we need to ensure that the building_functions column in the 1808 dataset is a comma-separated list, similar to the 1740 dataset. We can use the str.join() function to concatenate the building_functions list into a single string. Additionally, we need to ensure that the owner_family_name column is in a consistent format across both datasets.

**Step 3: Count the Number of Buildings Owned by Each Family in 1740**

Next, we need to count the number of buildings owned by each family in the 1740 dataset. We can use the groupby() function to group the data by owner_family_name and count the number of rows in each group.

**Step 4: Count the Number of Buildings Owned by Each Family in 1808**

Similarly, we need to count the number of buildings owned by each family in the 1808 dataset. Again, we can use the groupby() function to group the data by owner_family_name and count the number of rows in each group.

**Step 5: Calculate the Increase in Number of Buildings Owned by Each Family**

To calculate the increase in the number of buildings owned by each family from 1740 to 1808, we need to join the two datasets on the owner_family_name column and calculate the difference between the counts from 1808 and 1740.

**Step 6: Find the Family with the Largest Increase**

Finally, we need to find the family with the largest increase in the number of buildings owned from 1740 to 1808. We can use the idxmax() function to find the index of the maximum value in the increase column and then use that index to retrieve the corresponding family name.

**Step 7: Return the Family Name**

The final step is to return the family name with the largest increase in the number of buildings owned from 1740 to 1808.

The expected answer will be a single textual entity name, which is the family name that increased the number of buildings they owned the most from 1740 to 1808.","import pandas as pd

124,How many building changed from residential to commercial use between 1740 and 1808?,comparison,a single number,4,1,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to merge the two datasets to compare the building functions between 1740 and 1808. We can do this by matching the buildings based on their location (latitude and longitude) and building functions. We will create a new column that indicates whether a building's function changed between the two time periods.

**Step 2: Clean and Process the Building Functions Data**

Next, we need to clean and process the building functions data. In the 1740 dataset, the building functions are stored as a comma-separated list, while in the 1808 dataset, they are stored as a list. We will split the lists into separate rows for each function, so we can compare them easily.

**Step 3: Identify Residential and Commercial Functions**

We need to identify the residential and commercial functions in both datasets. We can do this by creating two new columns, one for residential functions and one for commercial functions. For example, residential functions might include ""residence"", ""dwelling"", etc., while commercial functions might include ""shop"", ""store"", etc.

**Step 4: Compare Building Functions between 1740 and 1808**

We will compare the residential and commercial functions for each building between 1740 and 1808. We will create a new column that indicates whether a building's function changed from residential to commercial (or vice versa) between the two time periods.

**Step 5: Count the Number of Buildings with Function Change**

Finally, we will count the number of buildings that changed from residential to commercial use between 1740 and 1808. We will sum up the count to get the final answer.

**Step 6: Filter Out Buildings with No Function Change**

We will filter out buildings that did not change their function between 1740 and 1808, as they do not meet the question's criteria.

**Step 7: Get the Final Answer**

We will get the final answer, which is the number of buildings that changed from residential to commercial use between 1740 and 1808.","import pandas as pd

126,How many buildings retained the same function across the two time periods?,comparison,a single number,0,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to merge the two datasets to compare the functions of buildings across the two time periods. We'll do this by matching buildings based on their unique combination of owner_first_name, owner_family_name, and location (longitude and latitude). We can use a library like pandas in Python to perform this merge.

**Step 2: Extract Building Functions**

Next, we'll extract the building functions from both datasets. In the 1740 dataset, the building functions are stored in a comma-separated list, while in the 1808 dataset, they are stored as a list. We'll need to convert the 1740 dataset's building functions to a list as well, so that we can compare them directly.

**Step 3: Compare Building Functions Across Time Periods**

We'll create a new column that indicates whether the building functions are the same across the two time periods. We can do this by comparing the lists of building functions from the two datasets. If the lists are identical, we'll set the new column to 1 (yes), otherwise, we'll set it to 0 (no).

**Step 4: Count Buildings with Same Functions**

Finally, we'll count the number of buildings that retained the same function across the two time periods. This will give us the answer to the question.

**Step 5: Output the Answer**

The final answer will be a single number indicating the count of buildings that retained the same function across the two time periods.","import pandas as pd

127,How many new families appeared in Venice in 1808 that were not present in 1740?,comparison,a single number,0,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to identify the unique families that existed in Venice in 1740 and 1808. To do this, we will merge the two datasets based on the owner_first_name and owner_family_name columns. We will perform a left join on the 1740 dataset and the 1808 dataset, using the owner_first_name and owner_family_name columns as the common keys. This will allow us to identify the families that appear in both datasets.

**Step 2: Identify Families that Appear in Both Datasets**

Next, we will identify the families that appear in both the 1740 and 1808 datasets. We will create a new column that combines the owner_first_name and owner_family_name columns from both datasets. We will then count the number of rows where the combined column is present in both datasets. This will give us the number of families that appeared in both 1740 and 1808.

**Step 3: Identify Families that Appear in 1808 but Not in 1740**

To find the new families that appeared in 1808, we will count the number of rows in the merged dataset where the combined column is only present in the 1808 dataset (i.e., the rows where the owner_first_name and owner_family_name columns are not present in the 1740 dataset). This will give us the number of new families that appeared in 1808.

**Step 4: Calculate the Number of New Families**

Finally, we will subtract the number of families that appeared in both 1740 and 1808 from the total number of families in the 1808 dataset. This will give us the number of new families that appeared in 1808.

**Step 5: Return the Answer**

128,Is there any decrease in the number of buildings held by a family on average from 1740 to 1808?,comparison,yes or no,0,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Understand the datasets**

* Review the provided datasets: buildings_1740.csv, buildings_1808.csv, and landmarks.csv to understand their structure, columns, and data types.
* Note that the buildings_1740.csv and buildings_1808.csv datasets contain information about buildings, while the landmarks.csv dataset contains information about landmarks in Venice.

**Step 2: Identify the relevant columns**

* From the buildings_1740.csv and buildings_1808.csv datasets, identify the columns that are relevant to the question:
	+ owner_family_name (to identify the family owning the buildings)
	+ building_functions_count (to count the number of buildings owned by each family)
* Note that the buildings_1808.csv dataset does not have a column for owner_first_name, so we will focus on the owner_family_name column.

**Step 3: Merge the datasets**

* Merge the buildings_1740.csv and buildings_1808.csv datasets on the owner_family_name column to create a new dataset that combines information from both time periods.
* This will allow us to compare the number of buildings owned by each family in 1740 and 1808.

**Step 4: Group by family name**

* Group the merged dataset by the owner_family_name column.
* For each group, calculate the average number of buildings owned in 1740 and 1808.

**Step 5: Compare the averages**

* Compare the average number of buildings owned by each family in 1740 and 1808.
* If the average number of buildings owned in 1740 is greater than the average number of buildings owned in 1808, then there is a decrease in the number of buildings held by a family on average from 1740 to 1808.

129,Are there any families who moved closer to the churches in general from 1740 to 1808?,comparison,yes or no,1,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Understand the datasets and the question**

* Review the provided datasets: buildings_1740, buildings_1808, and landmarks.
* Understand that we are looking for a comparison between the locations of buildings owned by the same families in 1740 and 1808, specifically to see if they moved closer to churches.

**Step 2: Identify common columns between datasets**

* Identify the columns that are common between the buildings_1740 and buildings_1808 datasets: owner_first_name, owner_family_name, longitude, and latitude.
* Identify the columns that are common between the buildings_1808 and landmarks datasets: longitude and latitude.

**Step 3: Merge the datasets**

* Merge the buildings_1740 and buildings_1808 datasets on the owner_family_name column to create a new dataset that combines the information of the same families in both years.
* This will allow us to compare the locations of the same families' buildings in both years.

**Step 4: Filter the merged dataset to include only buildings near churches**

* Merge the merged dataset from Step 3 with the landmarks dataset on the longitude and latitude columns to identify which buildings are near churches.
* Use a reasonable distance threshold (e.g., 100 meters) to determine which buildings are considered ""near"" a church.

**Step 5: Compare the locations of buildings near churches between 1740 and 1808**

* For each family that had a building near a church in both 1740 and 1808, calculate the distance between the two locations.
* Determine if the distance between the two locations is less than a reasonable threshold (e.g., 100 meters), indicating that the family moved closer to the church.

**Step 6: Answer the question**

* Count the number of families that moved closer to a church between 1740 and 1808.
* If the count is greater than 0, answer is yes. Otherwise, answer is no.

131,How many families who owned buildings in both 1740 and 1808 changed the type of buildings they owned?,comparison,a single number,0,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to merge the two datasets to identify the common owners. We will use the 'owner_first_name' and 'owner_family_name' columns as the matching keys. This will allow us to link the buildings owned by the same family in both 1740 and 1808.

**Step 2: Identify Common Owners**

Next, we will filter the merged dataset to only include rows where the 'owner_first_name' and 'owner_family_name' columns match between the 1740 and 1808 datasets. This will give us a list of families who owned buildings in both time periods.

**Step 3: Compare Building Functions**

We will then compare the 'building_functions' column from the 1740 dataset with the 'building_functions' column from the 1808 dataset for each common owner. If the functions are different, we will count this as a change in the type of building owned.

**Step 4: Count Changes in Building Type**

We will count the number of times the building functions changed for each common owner. If the building functions are the same, we will count it as 0 changes. If the building functions are different, we will count it as 1 change.

**Step 5: Sum Up the Changes**

Finally, we will sum up the total number of changes in building type across all common owners. This will give us the total number of families who changed the type of buildings they owned between 1740 and 1808.

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to merge the two datasets to compare the changes in building types and locations between 1740 and 1808. We can do this by matching the building locations (longitude and latitude) in both datasets.

**Step 2: Extract Commercial Buildings in 1740**

Next, we need to extract the buildings that were used as commercial buildings in 1740. We can do this by splitting the `building_functions` column in the 1740 dataset into individual functions and counting the number of rows where ""commercial"" is present.

**Step 3: Extract Commercial Buildings in 1808**

Similarly, we need to extract the buildings that were used as commercial buildings in 1808. We can do this by splitting the `building_functions` column in the 1808 dataset into individual functions and counting the number of rows where ""commercial"" is present.

**Step 4: Calculate the Change in Commercial Buildings**

We need to calculate the number of commercial buildings in each square (landmark) in 1740 and 1808. We can do this by joining the merged dataset with the Landmarks dataset based on the longitude and latitude coordinates.

**Step 5: Identify Squares with the Most Number of Commercial Buildings**

We need to identify the squares that had the most number of commercial buildings in 1740 and 1808. We can do this by grouping the data by landmark name and counting the number of commercial buildings in each square.

**Step 6: Compare the Changes**

Finally, we need to compare the number of commercial buildings in each square between 1740 and 1808 to determine if any squares with the most number of commercial buildings changed.

137,Which type of a building have been moved further away from the churches the most from 1740 to 1808?,comparison,a single entity name,1,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to merge the two datasets to compare the changes in building locations over time. We can do this by matching the building owners and their corresponding building IDs (if available) between the two datasets. Since there is no building ID column, we'll use a combination of the owner_first_name, owner_family_name, and building_functions_count columns to identify matching buildings. We'll create a new dataset, let's call it ""merged_buildings"", which contains all the information from both datasets.

**Step 2: Calculate the Distance Between Buildings and Churches**

Next, we need to calculate the distance between each building in the merged dataset and the closest church in the Landmarks dataset. We can use the longitude and latitude columns to calculate the Euclidean distance between each building and church. We'll create a new column in the merged dataset to store the distance to the closest church.

**Step 3: Filter Buildings with a Church Nearby**

We need to filter the merged dataset to only include buildings that have a church within a certain distance (e.g., 100 meters). This will ensure that we're only comparing buildings that are near a church in both 1740 and 1808.

**Step 4: Calculate the Change in Distance**

For the filtered buildings, we need to calculate the change in distance between the 1740 and 1808 locations. We'll create a new column to store this value.

**Step 5: Group by Building Type and Calculate the Average Change in Distance**

We need to group the filtered dataset by the building_functions column (which contains the type of building) and calculate the average change in distance for each building type. This will give us an idea of which building type has moved the most away from churches over time.

**Step 6: Identify the Building Type with the Largest Average Change in Distance**

Finally, we need to identify the building type with the largest average change in distance. This will be the answer to our question.

**Step 7: Determine the Final Answer**

138,Which type of a building have been moved closer to the churches the most from 1740 to 1808?,comparison,a single entity name,1,0,"Here's a step-by-step plan to answer the question:

**Step 1: Merge the 1740 and 1808 Buildings Datasets**

First, we need to merge the two datasets to compare the locations of buildings in 1740 and 1808. We can do this by matching the building owners' names and addresses (longitude and latitude) between the two datasets.

**Step 2: Filter the Merged Dataset to Include Only Buildings that are Near Churches**

Next, we need to identify the buildings that are near churches. We can do this by joining the merged dataset with the Landmarks Dataset, filtering for landmarks with type ""church"", and then calculating the distance between each building and the nearest church using the longitude and latitude coordinates.

**Step 3: Calculate the Distance Between Buildings and Churches in 1740 and 1808**

We need to calculate the distance between each building and the nearest church in both 1740 and 1808. We can use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere (in this case, the Earth).

**Step 4: Determine the Change in Distance Between Buildings and Churches**

We need to calculate the difference in distance between each building and the nearest church between 1740 and 1808. This will give us a measure of how much each building has moved closer to or further from the nearest church.

**Step 5: Identify the Type of Building that has Moved the Most**

Finally, we need to identify the type of building that has moved the most towards the nearest church. We can do this by grouping the data by building type (e.g. residential, commercial, etc.) and calculating the average change in distance for each type.

**Step 6: Determine the Building Type that has Moved Closer to Churches the Most**

We need to determine which type of building has moved the most towards churches, i.e., the type with the largest average decrease in distance.

**Step 1: Load the datasets**

* Import the three datasets: buildings_1740, buildings_1808, and landmarks into a data analysis environment (e.g., pandas in Python).
* Ensure that each dataset is correctly loaded and accessible for analysis.

**Step 2: Preprocess the building functions column in the 1740 dataset**

* Since the building_functions column in the 1740 dataset is a comma-separated list, we need to split this column into separate rows, one for each function.
* Use a function like `str.split()` or `split()` to split the string into a list of functions.
* Create a new column, e.g., building_functions_list, to store the split list of functions.

**Step 3: Count the number of buildings with more than one function in 1740**

* Filter the 1740 dataset to only include rows where the length of the building_functions_list is greater than 1.
* Count the number of rows that meet this condition.
* Store this count in a variable, e.g., num_buildings_1740.

**Step 4: Preprocess the building functions column in the 1808 dataset**

* Since the building_functions column in the 1808 dataset is already a list, no preprocessing is needed.
* However, we need to ensure that the data type is consistent, so we might need to convert the column to a list type.

**Step 5: Count the number of buildings with more than one function in 1808**

* Filter the 1808 dataset to only include rows where the length of the building_functions is greater than 1.
* Count the number of rows that meet this condition.
* Store this count in a variable, e.g., num_buildings_1808.

**Step 6: Compare the counts**

* Compare the counts from 1740 (num_buildings_1740) and 1808 (num_buildings_1808) to determine if the number of buildings with more than one function increased over time.
* If num_buildings_1808 is greater than num_buildings_1740, the answer is yes; otherwise, the answer is no.

Count the number of buildings that were owned by the Michiel family in 1740 but not in 1808. If the count is greater than 0, it means the Michiel family lost some buildings from 1740 to 1808.

**Step 6: Determine the Answer**
If the count from Step 5 is greater than 0, the answer is ""yes"", indicating that the Michiel family lost some buildings from 1740 to 1808. If the count is 0, the answer is ""no"".","import pandas as pd
