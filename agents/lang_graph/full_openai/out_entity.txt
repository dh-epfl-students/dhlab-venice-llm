QUESTION: What is the average rent price of all buildings that are located within 100 meters from the closest church in 1740?
--0-1--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "What is the average rent price of all buildings that are located within 100 meters from the closest church in 1740?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the corresponding columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "average rent price" refers to the column "rent_price" in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
2. The phrase "buildings" refers to the entire dataset of buildings in 1740 (dataset 1).
3. The phrase "church" refers to the column "landmark_type" in the Landmarks Dataset (dataset 3).

Now, we can compile these matches:

- "average rent price" corresponds to "rent_price" in dataset 1.
- "buildings" corresponds to the dataset 1 as a whole.
- "church" corresponds to "landmark_type" in dataset 3.

Thus, the output will be:

[("average rent price", "rent_price", 1), ("church", "landmark_type", 3)]

QUESTION: What is the average building area of all buildings that are located within 100 meters from the closest church in 1808?
--0-1--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "What is the average building area of all buildings that are located within 100 meters from the closest church in 1808?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the corresponding columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "average building area" refers to the "building_area" column in the 1808 Buildings Dataset (dataset 2).
2. The phrase "church" refers to the "landmark_type" column in the Landmarks Dataset (dataset 3).
3. The phrase "1808" indicates that we are focusing on the 1808 Buildings Dataset (dataset 2) and the Landmarks Dataset (dataset 3).

Now, we can compile the relevant matches:

- "average building area" corresponds to "building_area" in dataset 2.
- "church" corresponds to "landmark_type" in dataset 3.

Thus, the output will be:

[("average building area", "building_area", 2), ("church", "landmark_type", 3)]

MAPPINGs: [('average building area', 'building_area', 2), ('church', 'landmark_type', 3)]



The phrase "average building area" refers to a general concept rather than a specific value that would be found in the "building_area" column. The column contains numerical values representing the area of individual buildings, not an average. Therefore, the phrase does not correspond to a specific value in that column.

QUESTION: On average, how much more expensive are houses near the squares within 100 meters compared to those further away in 1740?
--1-2--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question, we need to identify the relevant phrases that correspond to the columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "houses" refers to the types of buildings, which can be found in the "building_functions" column of the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
2. The phrase "squares" refers to the "landmark_type" column in the Landmarks Dataset (dataset 3).
3. The phrase "expensive" relates to the "rent_price" column in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).

Now, let's compile these findings into the required format:

- "houses" corresponds to "building_functions" in dataset 1.
- "squares" corresponds to "landmark_type" in dataset 3.
- "expensive" corresponds to "rent_price" in dataset 1.

Since the question is specifically about the year 1740, we will only include the relevant columns from dataset 1 and dataset 3.

Thus, the output will be:

[("houses", "building_functions", 1), ("squares", "landmark_type", 3), ("expensive", "rent_price", 1)]

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "How many buildings are located around the church of Saint Paul within 100 meters in 1808?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the appropriate columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "buildings" refers to the entire dataset of buildings, which corresponds to both the 1740 and 1808 datasets. However, since the question specifies "in 1808," we will focus on the 1808 dataset.
2. The phrase "church of Saint Paul" refers to a specific landmark, which corresponds to the "landmark_name" column in the landmarks dataset.
3. The phrase "within 100 meters" does not directly correspond to any specific column in the datasets, as there are no columns that measure distance in this context.

Now, we can compile the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns:

- "buildings" corresponds to the dataset of buildings in 1808, but we will not specify a column since it refers to the entire dataset.
- "church of Saint Paul" corresponds to the "landmark_name" column in the landmarks dataset.

Thus, the output will be:

[("buildings", "building_functions", 2), ("church of Saint Paul", "landmark_name", 3)]

MAPPINGs: [('buildings', 'building_functions', 2), ('church of Saint Paul', 'landmark_name', 3)]

QUESTION: How many houses are located around the square of San Marco within 100 meters in 1808?
--1-2--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "How many houses are located around the square of San Marco within 100 meters in 1808?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the appropriate columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "houses" refers to the types of buildings, which can be found in the "building_functions" column of the 1808 Buildings Dataset (dataset 2).
2. The phrase "square of San Marco" refers to a specific landmark, which corresponds to the "landmark_name" column in the Landmarks Dataset (dataset 3).
3. The phrase "1808" indicates that we should focus on the 1808 Buildings Dataset (dataset 2) and the Landmarks Dataset (dataset 3).

Now, let's compile the matches:

- "houses" matches with "building_functions" in dataset 2.
- "square of San Marco" matches with "landmark_name" in dataset 3.

Thus, the output will be:

[("houses", "building_functions", 2), ("square of San Marco", "landmark_name", 3)]

MAPPINGs: [('houses', 'building_functions', 2), ('square of San Marco', 'landmark_name', 3)]



The phrase "houses" refers to a type of function that a building may serve, which could be one of the specific values in the "building_functions" column. Therefore, it is possible that "houses" corresponds to one or more specific values in that column.

QUESTION: Are the buildings located within 100 meters from San Marco more expensive than the buildings located within 100 meters from other squares in 1740?
--1-2--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question, we need to identify the relevant phrases that correspond to the columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "buildings located within 100 meters from San Marco" refers to the "landmark_name" column in the landmarks dataset (dataset 3) because it mentions a specific landmark.
2. The phrase "more expensive" relates to the "rent price" which corresponds to the "rent_price" column in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
3. The phrase "buildings located within 100 meters from other squares" again refers to the "landmark_name" column in the landmarks dataset (dataset 3) since it mentions squares.

Now, we can match these phrases to their respective columns:

- "San Marco" corresponds to "landmark_name" in dataset 3.
- "more expensive" relates to "rent price" in dataset 1.
- "other squares" also corresponds to "landmark_name" in dataset 3.

Since the question specifically asks about the time 1740, we will focus on dataset 1 for the rent price and dataset 3 for the landmark names.

Thus, the output will be:

[("San Marco", "landmark_name", 3), ("more expensive", "rent_price", 1), ("other squares", "landmark_name", 3)]

QUESTION: Which neighborhood has the highest density of different families in 1740?
--0-0--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "Which neighborhood has the highest density of different families in 1740?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "neighborhood" refers to the concept of a district or area where buildings are located. In the 1740 dataset, there is no direct column for "neighborhood," but we can infer that it relates to the "parish" column, which indicates the area where the buildings are located.

2. The phrase "density of different families" suggests we are interested in the unique family names of building owners. This corresponds to the "owner_family_name" column in the 1740 dataset.

Now, we can compile the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns:

- "neighborhood" matches with "parish" in dataset 1.
- "different families" matches with "owner_family_name" in dataset 1.

Thus, the output will be:

3. The phrase "average" suggests a calculation involving the count of buildings per district, which implies the need to consider the "building_functions_count" column for counting purposes.

Now, we can match the identified phrases to the corresponding columns:

- "buildings" corresponds to the dataset as a whole, specifically dataset 2.
- "district" corresponds to the "district" column in dataset 2.
- "average" does not correspond to a specific column but indicates a calculation involving the count of buildings.

Thus, the relevant matches are:

- "district" with "district" in dataset 2.

The final output will be:

[("buildings", "building_functions_count", 2), ("district", "district", 2)]

1. The phrase "district" refers to the "district" column in the 1808 Buildings Dataset (dataset 2).
2. The phrase "largest buildings" implies we are interested in the "building area" column, which is also found in the 1808 Buildings Dataset (dataset 2).

Since the question specifically asks about the year 1808, we will only refer to the columns in the 1808 Buildings Dataset.

Thus, the relevant matches are:
- "district" corresponds to "district" in dataset 2.
- "largest buildings" corresponds to "building area" in dataset 2.

QUESTION: Among all the parishes, what is the highest density of buildings with multiple functions in 1740?
--0-0--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "Among all the parishes, what is the highest density of buildings with multiple functions in 1740?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the corresponding columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "parishes" refers to the "parish" column in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
2. The phrase "density of buildings" relates to the concept of buildings, which refers to the entire dataset of buildings in 1740.
3. The phrase "multiple functions" indicates that we are interested in buildings that have more than one function, which corresponds to the "building_functions_count" column in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).

Now, we can compile the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns:

- "parishes" matches with "parish" in dataset 1.
- "density of buildings" refers to the buildings in dataset 1.
- "multiple functions" matches with "building_functions_count" in dataset 1.

Thus, the output will be:

[("parishes", "parish", 1), ("density of buildings", "building_functions", 1), ("multiple functions", "building_functions_count", 1)]

MAPPINGs: [('parishes', 'parish', 1), ('density of buildings', 'building_functions', 1), ('multiple functions', 'building_functions_count', 1)]



[[False]]






[[False]]






The phrase "multiple functions" suggests a general concept rather than a specific value. The column "building_functions_count" is expected to contain numerical values representing the count of functions a building serves. Since "multiple functions" does not specify a particular count, it does not correspond to a specific value in that column. 

Therefore, the response is [[False]].

QUESTION: Among all the districts, what is the highest density of buildings with multiple functions in 1808?
--0-0--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "Among all the districts, what is the highest density of buildings with multiple functions in 1808?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the appropriate columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "districts" refers to the "district" column in the 1808 Buildings Dataset (dataset 2).
2. The phrase "density of buildings" implies a focus on the buildings themselves, which corresponds to the "building_functions_count" column in the 1808 Buildings Dataset (dataset 2) since it indicates the number of functions a building serves.
3. The phrase "multiple functions" suggests that we are interested in buildings that have more than one function, which again relates to the "building_functions_count" column in the 1808 Buildings Dataset (dataset 2).

Now, we can compile the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns:

- "districts" matches with "district" in dataset 2.
- "density of buildings" and "multiple functions" both relate to "building_functions_count" in dataset 2.

Thus, the output will be:

[("districts", "district", 2), ("density of buildings", "building_functions_count", 2), ("multiple functions", "building_functions_count", 2)]

MAPPINGs: [('districts', 'district', 2), ('density of buildings', 'building_functions_count', 2), ('multiple functions', 'building_functions_count', 2)]



[[False]]






The phrase "density of buildings" does not refer to a specific value that would be found in the "building_functions_count" column. Instead, it is a general concept that describes the concentration of buildings, which does not correspond to a numerical count of building functions. Therefore, the response is [[False]].






The phrase "multiple functions" suggests that there are various roles or uses for a building, which could correspond to a specific value in the "building_functions_count" column, indicating the number of functions a building serves. Since the count of functions could indeed be a specific numerical value, the phrase may refer to a specific value in that column.

Output: [[True]]

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "What is the average size difference between the districts with the largest and the smallest buildings in 1808?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the corresponding columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "average size difference" refers to the concept of building area, which is found in the 1808 Buildings Dataset.
2. The phrase "districts" refers to the column "district" in the 1808 Buildings Dataset.
3. The phrases "largest" and "smallest buildings" refer to the "building_area" column in the 1808 Buildings Dataset.

Now, let's compile these matches:

- "average size difference" corresponds to "building_area" in dataset 2.
- "districts" corresponds to "district" in dataset 2.
- "largest" and "smallest buildings" also correspond to "building_area" in dataset 2.

Thus, the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns are:

- "districts" -> "district" (dataset 2)
- "largest buildings" -> "building_area" (dataset 2)
- "smallest buildings" -> "building_area" (dataset 2)

Since "largest" and "smallest" refer to the same column, we will only list "building_area" once for those phrases.

The final output will be:

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "Are there any parishes with more than 5 buildings owned by a single family in 1740?", we need to identify the relevant phrases that correspond to the columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "parishes" refers to the "parish" column in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
2. The phrase "buildings" refers to the overall dataset of buildings in 1740, which is dataset 1.
3. The phrase "owned by a single family" refers to the "owner_family_name" column in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).

Now, we can compile these matches:

- "parishes" matches with "parish" in dataset 1.
- "buildings" matches with the overall dataset 1.
- "owned by a single family" matches with "owner_family_name" in dataset 1.

Thus, the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns are:

- ("parishes", "parish", 1)
- ("buildings", "building_functions", 1)  # This is a bit of a stretch since it refers to the dataset as a whole, but we can consider it as a reference to the buildings in the dataset.
- ("owned by a single family", "owner_family_name", 1)

However, since "buildings" does not directly correspond to a specific column, we will not include it in the final output.

QUESTION: What is the average distance between schools and their nearest church in 1740?
--1-2--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "What is the average distance between schools and their nearest church in 1740?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "schools" refers to the functions of buildings, which can be found in the "building_functions" column of the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
2. The phrase "church" refers to the "landmark_type" column in the Landmarks Dataset (dataset 3), where churches are listed.

Now, we can compile the matches:

- "schools" corresponds to "building_functions" in dataset 1.
- "church" corresponds to "landmark_type" in dataset 3.

Since the question specifically asks about the year 1740, we will focus on dataset 1 for the building functions and dataset 3 for the church type.

--0-0--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "On average, are buildings with multiple functions more expensive than the ones with a single function in 1740?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the appropriate columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "buildings with multiple functions" refers to the concept of building functions, which can be found in the column "building_functions" in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
2. The phrase "more expensive" relates to the cost aspect, which corresponds to the "rent_price" column in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
3. The phrase "single function" also refers to the "building_functions" column, as it implies a count of functions.

Since the question is specifically about the year 1740, we will only refer to the columns in the 1740 Buildings Dataset.

Thus, the relevant matches are:
- "buildings with multiple functions" -> "building_functions" (dataset 1)
- "more expensive" -> "rent_price" (dataset 1)
- "single function" -> "building_functions" (dataset 1)

QUESTION: What is the most common combination of functions of multi-functional buildings in 1740?
--0-0--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "What is the most common combination of functions of multi-functional buildings in 1740?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the appropriate columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "most common combination of functions" refers to the "building functions" column, which is present in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
2. The term "multi-functional buildings" implies that we are looking at buildings that have multiple functions, which relates to the "building_functions_count" column in the same dataset, as it indicates the number of functions a building serves.

Now, we can compile the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns:

- "combination of functions" matches with "building_functions" in dataset 1.
- "multi-functional buildings" relates to "building_functions_count" in dataset 1.

Thus, the output will be:

[("combination of functions", "building_functions", 1), ("multi-functional buildings", "building_functions_count", 1)]

MAPPINGs: [('combination of functions', 'building_functions', 1), ('multi-functional buildings', 'building_functions_count', 1)]



[[False]]






The phrase "multi-functional buildings" does not refer to a specific numerical value that would be found in the "building_functions_count" column. Instead, it describes a type of building that may have multiple functions, but it does not indicate a specific count of those functions. Therefore, the response is [[False]].

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "What is the most common combination of functions of multi-functional buildings in 1808?", we need to identify the relevant phrases that correspond to the columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "most common combination of functions" refers to the functions that buildings serve, which corresponds to the column "building_functions" in the 1808 Buildings Dataset.
2. The term "multi-functional buildings" implies that we are looking at buildings that have more than one function, which relates to the column "building_functions_count" in the 1808 Buildings Dataset, as it indicates the number of functions a building serves.

Since the question specifically asks about the year 1808, we will only refer to the columns in the 1808 Buildings Dataset.

Thus, the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns are:
- "functions" -> "building_functions" (dataset 2)
- "multi-functional buildings" -> "building_functions_count" (dataset 2)

Putting this together, the output will be:

[("functions", "building_functions", 2), ("multi-functional buildings", "building_functions_count", 2)]

MAPPINGs: [('functions', 'building_functions', 2), ('multi-functional buildings', 'building_functions_count', 2)]



The phrase "functions" is too general and does not refer to any specific value that would be found in the "building_functions" column. It simply indicates the category of data without pinpointing a particular function. Therefore, the response is [[False]].






The phrase "multi-functional buildings" refers to a general concept of buildings that serve multiple purposes, rather than a specific numerical value that would be found in the "building_functions_count" column. The "building_functions_count" column contains numerical values representing the count of functions a building serves, not descriptive phrases. Therefore, the phrase does not correspond to a specific value in that column.

1. The phrase "buildings" refers to the entire dataset of buildings in 1740, which corresponds to dataset 1.
2. The name "Zuanne Don" refers to the owner of the buildings, which corresponds to the columns "owner_first_name" and "owner_family_name" in dataset 1.

Now, let's compile the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns:

- "Zuanne Don" can be matched to both "owner_first_name" and "owner_family_name" in dataset 1.
- "buildings" refers to the dataset itself, but we will not match it to a specific column since it is a general term.

Thus, the output will include the matches for "Zuanne Don" with the respective columns in dataset 1.

The final output is:
[("Zuanne Don", "owner_first_name", 1), ("Zuanne Don", "owner_family_name", 1)]

MAPPINGs: [('Zuanne Don', 'owner_first_name', 1), ('Zuanne Don', 'owner_family_name', 1)]

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "How many buildings does the family of Michiel own in 1808?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the appropriate columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "buildings" refers to the entire dataset of buildings, which corresponds to both datasets 1 and 2. However, since the question specifically mentions "in 1808," we will focus on dataset 2.
2. The phrase "family of Michiel" refers to the owner of the buildings. In the 1808 dataset, the relevant columns for the owner's name are "owner_first_name" and "owner_family_name." Since "Michiel" is a first name, we will match it to "owner_first_name."

Now, we can compile the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns:

- "buildings" corresponds to the general context of the dataset (not a specific column).
- "family of Michiel" corresponds to "owner_first_name" in dataset 2.

Thus, the output will be:

[("family of Michiel", "owner_first_name", 2)]

MAPPINGs: [('family of Michiel', 'owner_first_name', 2)]



The phrase "family of Michiel" does not refer to a specific value in the column "owner_first_name." Instead, it is a general reference to a family associated with the name Michiel, which does not indicate a specific first name. Therefore, the response is [[False]].

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "Which family owns the most number of buildings per parish on average in 1740?", we need to identify the relevant phrases that correspond to the columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "family" refers to the column "owner_family_name" in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
2. The phrase "buildings" refers to the entire dataset of buildings in 1740, which is dataset 1.
3. The phrase "parish" refers to the column "parish" in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).

Now, we can compile the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns:

- "family" matches with "owner_family_name" in dataset 1.
- "buildings" is a general reference to the dataset itself, so it does not correspond to a specific column.
- "parish" matches with "parish" in dataset 1.

1. The phrase "family" refers to the column "owner_family_name" in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
2. The phrase "buildings" refers to the entire dataset of buildings in 1740, which is dataset 1.
3. The phrase "district" does not have a corresponding column in the 1740 dataset, as it is only present in the 1808 Buildings Dataset (dataset 2).

Since the question specifically asks about 1740, we will only focus on the columns from dataset 1.

Thus, the relevant matches are:
- "family" -> "owner_family_name" from dataset 1
- "buildings" -> (implied from the dataset itself, but not a specific column)
- "district" does not apply here since it is not in dataset 1.

Therefore, the output will be:

[("family", "owner_family_name", 1)]

MAPPINGs: [('family', 'owner_family_name', 1)]



The phrase "family" is a general term that refers to a group of related individuals and does not specify a particular family name that would be found in the "owner_family_name" column. Therefore, it does not correspond to any specific value in that column.

QUESTION: What type of building is owned the most by lawyers in 1740?
--1-1--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "What type of building is owned the most by lawyers in 1740?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "type of building" refers to the functions that the building serves, which corresponds to the column "building_functions" in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
2. The phrase "owned by lawyers" refers to the profession of the building owner, which corresponds to the column "owner_profession" in the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).
3. The question specifies "in 1740," indicating that we should only consider the 1740 Buildings Dataset.

Now, we can compile the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns:

- "type of building" matches with "building_functions" in dataset 1.
- "owned by lawyers" matches with "owner_profession" in dataset 1.

Thus, the output will be:

[("type of building", "building_functions", 1), ("owned by lawyers", "owner_profession", 1)]

MAPPINGs: [('type of building', 'building_functions', 1), ('owned by lawyers', 'owner_profession', 1)]



[[False]]






The phrase "owned by lawyers" suggests a specific profession, which is "lawyers." This could correspond to a specific value in the "owner_profession" column, as it indicates a particular type of owner. Therefore, the response is [[True]].

QUESTION: How many people were relocated by more than 1km from 1740 to 1808?
--0-0--

LLM OUTPUT: In the question "How many people were relocated by more than 1km from 1740 to 1808?", we need to identify phrases that correspond to columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "people" can refer to both the first name and family name of building owners or tenants. Therefore, it can be matched to:
   - "owner_first_name" from dataset 1 (1740)
   - "owner_family_name" from dataset 1 (1740)
   - "owner_first_name" from dataset 2 (1808)
   - "owner_family_name" from dataset 2 (1808)

2. The phrase "1km" does not correspond to any specific column in the datasets.

3. The phrase "relocated" implies a change in location, which would involve comparing the longitude and latitude from both datasets, but it does not directly match any specific column.

Since we have identified relevant phrases that correspond to columns in both datasets, we can compile them into the required format.

Thus, the output will be:
[("people", "owner_first_name", 1), ("people", "owner_family_name", 1), ("people", "owner_first_name", 2), ("people", "owner_family_name", 2)]

QUESTION: What is the average distance moved by individuals who owned buildings in both 1740 and 1808?
--0-0--

LLM OUTPUT: In the question, we need to identify phrases that correspond to columns in the datasets related to buildings in 1740 and 1808.

1. The phrase "individuals who owned buildings" refers to the owners of the buildings, which can be matched to the columns "owner_first_name" and "owner_family_name" in both datasets.
2. The phrase "in both 1740 and 1808" indicates that we need to consider both datasets.

Now, let's match the relevant phrases with their corresponding column names:

- "individuals" can be matched to "owner_first_name" and "owner_family_name" in both datasets.
- "owned buildings" can also be matched to the same columns as it refers to the owners of the buildings.

Thus, the output will include the owner-related columns from both datasets.

The final output is:
[("individuals", "owner_first_name", 1), ("individuals", "owner_family_name", 1), ("individuals", "owner_first_name", 2), ("individuals", "owner_family_name", 2)]

[[False]]






The phrase "individuals" does not refer to a specific family name that would be found in the "owner_family_name" column. Instead, it is a general term that could encompass many different family names. Therefore, it does not correspond to any specific value in that column.

Output: [[False]]

QUESTION: How many more buildings does the family of Michiel own in 1808 compared to 1740?
--1-1--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "How many more buildings does the family of Michiel own in 1808 compared to 1740?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the appropriate columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "family of Michiel" refers to the column "owner_family_name" in both datasets, as it pertains to the family name of the building owner.
2. The phrase "buildings" refers to the entire dataset, so it will be associated with both datasets.
3. The question specifies two different years: 1808 and 1740, which means we will be looking at both datasets.

Now, let's match the phrases:

- "family of Michiel" corresponds to "owner_family_name" in both datasets.
- "buildings" corresponds to the datasets themselves, but we will not specify a column for this as it refers to the whole dataset.

Thus, the relevant matches are:

- For 1740: ("family of Michiel", "owner_family_name", 1)
- For 1808: ("family of Michiel", "owner_family_name", 2)

Putting it all together, the output will be:

[("family of Michiel", "owner_family_name", 1), ("family of Michiel", "owner_family_name", 2)]

MAPPINGs: [('family of Michiel', 'owner_family_name', 1), ('family of Michiel', 'owner_family_name', 2)]



The phrase "family of Michiel" refers to a specific family name, which could correspond to a value in the "owner_family_name" column. Therefore, it is likely that this phrase may refer to a specific value in that column.

Output: [[True]]






The phrase "family of Michiel" refers specifically to a family name, which could correspond to a specific value in the "owner_family_name" column. Therefore, it is plausible that this phrase may refer to one or more specific values in that column.

2. The question is asking about both periods (1740 and 1808), so we will look for matches in both datasets.

Now, let's compile the matches:

- "family of Michiel" matches with "owner_family_name" in dataset 1 (1740) and dataset 2 (1808).

Thus, the output will be:

[("family of Michiel", "owner_family_name", 1), ("family of Michiel", "owner_family_name", 2)]

MAPPINGs: [('family of Michiel', 'owner_family_name', 1), ('family of Michiel', 'owner_family_name', 2)]



The phrase "family of Michiel" refers to a specific family name, which could correspond to a value in the "owner_family_name" column. Therefore, it is likely that this phrase may refer to a specific value in that column.

Output: [[True]]






The phrase "family of Michiel" refers specifically to a family name, which could correspond to a specific value in the "owner_family_name" column. Therefore, it is plausible that this phrase may refer to one or more specific values in that column.

Output: [[True]]

QUESTION: How many buildings retained the same function across the two time periods?
--0-0--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "How many buildings retained the same function across the two time periods?", we need to identify the relevant phrases that correspond to the columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "buildings" refers to the entire dataset, which means we will look at both datasets (1 and 2).
2. The phrase "function" refers to the different uses of the buildings, which can be found in the "building_functions" column in both datasets.
3. The phrase "two time periods" indicates that we are considering both the 1740 and 1808 datasets.

Now, we can match the identified phrases to the corresponding columns in the datasets:

- "buildings" corresponds to the datasets themselves, but we will focus on the functions.
- "function" corresponds to "building_functions" in both datasets.

Thus, the relevant matches are:
- "buildings" -> (not a specific column, but indicates the datasets)
- "function" -> ("building_functions", "building_functions", 1) for the 1740 dataset
- "function" -> ("building_functions", "building_functions", 2) for the 1808 dataset

Putting this together, the output will be:

[("buildings", "building_functions", 1), ("buildings", "building_functions", 2)] 

However, since "buildings" is not a specific column, we will focus on the functions only:

--0-0--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "Did any families transition from being tenants in 1740 to building owners in 1808?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the appropriate columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "families" refers to the family names of both tenants in 1740 and owners in 1808. This corresponds to the "owner_family_name" column in the 1808 dataset and the "tenant_name" column in the 1740 dataset (though "tenant_name" is not a family name, it can be inferred that tenants are part of families).

2. The phrase "tenants" specifically refers to the "tenant_name" column in the 1740 dataset.

3. The phrase "owners" refers to the "owner_family_name" column in the 1808 dataset.

Now, we can compile the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns:

- "families" corresponds to "owner_family_name" in dataset 2 and can also be inferred from "tenant_name" in dataset 1.
- "tenants" corresponds to "tenant_name" in dataset 1.
- "owners" corresponds to "owner_family_name" in dataset 2.

Thus, the output will be:

[("families", "tenant_name", 1), ("families", "owner_family_name", 2)]

MAPPINGs: [('families', 'tenant_name', 1), ('families', 'owner_family_name', 2)]



The phrase "families" does not refer to a specific tenant name but rather to a general concept of multiple individuals or groups. Therefore, it does not correspond to any specific value in the "tenant_name" column.

4. The phrase "1740" indicates that we will also refer to the 1740 Buildings Dataset (dataset 1).

Now, let's match these phrases to the corresponding columns:

- "buildings" corresponds to the entire dataset, so we will note it for both datasets.
- "church" corresponds to the "landmark_type" column in dataset 3.
- The mention of "1808" allows us to refer to the 1808 Buildings Dataset.
- The mention of "1740" allows us to refer to the 1740 Buildings Dataset.

Thus, the relevant matches are:
- For "buildings" in 1808: (detected_phrase: "buildings", column_name: "building_functions", dataset_number: 2)
- For "buildings" in 1740: (detected_phrase: "buildings", column_name: "building_functions", dataset_number: 1)
- For "church": (detected_phrase: "church", column_name: "landmark_type", dataset_number: 3)

Now, we can compile these into the required format:

Output: 
[("buildings", "building_functions", 1), ("buildings", "building_functions", 2), ("church", "landmark_type", 3)]

QUESTION: What are the names of the most densely populated squares with the most number of buildings within 100 meters in both periods 1740 and 1808?
--0-1--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question, we need to identify the relevant phrases that correspond to the columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "most densely populated squares" refers to "squares" which corresponds to the "landmark_type" column in the landmarks dataset (dataset 3).
2. The phrase "most number of buildings" refers to the concept of buildings, which can be linked to both datasets 1 and 2, specifically to the buildings themselves.
3. The phrase "in both periods 1740 and 1808" indicates that we need to consider both datasets.

Now, let's match the identified phrases to the corresponding columns:

- "squares" matches with "landmark_type" in dataset 3.
- "buildings" can be linked to the general concept of buildings in both datasets 1 and 2.

Thus, the output will include the relevant phrases and their corresponding columns from the datasets:

QUESTION: Which type of a building have been moved further away from the churches the most from 1740 to 1808?
--0-1--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "Which type of a building have been moved further away from the churches the most from 1740 to 1808?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the corresponding columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "type of a building" refers to the functions that buildings serve, which can be found in both datasets:
   - In the 1740 dataset, this corresponds to the column "building_functions".
   - In the 1808 dataset, this also corresponds to the column "building_functions".

2. The phrase "churches" refers to the landmarks, specifically the type of landmark, which is captured in the landmarks dataset:
   - This corresponds to the column "landmark_type" in the landmarks dataset.

3. The question mentions both 1740 and 1808, so we will include relevant columns from both datasets.

Now, we can compile the matches:

- "type of a building" matches "building_functions" in both datasets.
- "churches" matches "landmark_type" in the landmarks dataset.

QUESTION: Did the number of buildings with more than one function increase over time from 1740 to 1808?
--0-0--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "Did the number of buildings with more than one function increase over time from 1740 to 1808?", we need to identify the relevant phrases that correspond to the columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "number of buildings" refers to the overall count of buildings, which is not directly linked to a specific column but implies the datasets themselves.
2. The phrase "more than one function" relates to the concept of building functions, which can be found in both datasets. Specifically, it corresponds to the "building_functions_count" column, as it indicates the number of functions a building serves.
3. The phrase "over time" indicates a comparison between the two datasets, 1740 and 1808.

Now, we can match the relevant phrases to the columns in the datasets:

- "number of buildings" does not correspond to a specific column.
- "more than one function" corresponds to "building_functions_count" in both datasets, as we are interested in buildings with a count greater than one.

Thus, the relevant matches are:
- "more than one function" with "building_functions_count" from dataset 1 (1740).
- "more than one function" with "building_functions_count" from dataset 2 (1808).

Putting this together, the output will be:

[("more than one function", "building_functions_count", 1), ("more than one function", "building_functions_count", 2)]

MAPPINGs: [('more than one function', 'building_functions_count', 1), ('more than one function', 'building_functions_count', 2)]



The phrase "more than one function" does not correspond to a specific value in the "building_functions_count" column. Instead, it is a general description that implies a count greater than one, but it does not specify an exact numerical value. Therefore, the response is [[False]].






The phrase "more than one function" suggests a qualitative description rather than a specific numerical value. The column "building_functions_count" contains numerical values that represent the count of functions a building serves. Since "more than one function" does not specify an exact count (e.g., 2, 3, etc.), it does not correspond to a specific value in that column.

Output: [[False]]

QUESTION: Did the family of Michiel loose any of their buildings from 1740 to 1808?
--1-1--

LLM OUTPUT: To analyze the question "Did the family of Michiel lose any of their buildings from 1740 to 1808?", we need to identify the relevant phrases and match them to the appropriate columns in the datasets.

1. The phrase "family of Michiel" refers to the column "owner_family_name" in both datasets, as it pertains to the family name of the building owner.
2. The term "buildings" refers to the entire dataset, so we will consider the relevant columns in both datasets for buildings.

Now, let's compile the matches:

- "family of Michiel" corresponds to "owner_family_name" in both datasets (1 and 2).
- "buildings" does not correspond to a specific column but refers to the datasets as a whole.

Thus, the relevant matches are:

1. ("family of Michiel", "owner_family_name", 1)
2. ("family of Michiel", "owner_family_name", 2)

Putting it all together, the output is:

[("family of Michiel", "owner_family_name", 1), ("family of Michiel", "owner_family_name", 2)]

MAPPINGs: [('family of Michiel', 'owner_family_name', 1), ('family of Michiel', 'owner_family_name', 2)]



The phrase "family of Michiel" refers to a specific family name, which could correspond to a value in the "owner_family_name" column. Therefore, it is likely that this phrase may refer to a specific value in that column.

Output: [[True]]






The phrase "family of Michiel" refers specifically to a family name, which could correspond to a specific value in the "owner_family_name" column. Therefore, it is plausible that this phrase may refer to one or more specific values in that column.

Output: [[True]]
